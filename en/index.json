Conference organizers offer a Response Team acting in order to guarantee such an environment. Therefore: We will not tolerate harassment, inappropriate discrimination, or public humiliation of any kind. We will not tolerate non-compliance with Brazilian laws. Regardless of their role, every person taking part in the conference is subject to these rules. Thus we understand: Harassment is the act of insisting, persecuting, or coercing someone into involuntary behavior. Inappropriate discrimination is the act of pulling apart, insulting, or humiliating someone by promoting their exclusion based on any particular attribute. Public humiliation is the act of subjugating, pulling down, ridiculing, or publicly promoting the vexation of others. Target audience and suitability The target audience of the conference also includes children and adolescents; thus we stand for a suitable environment for all age groups. In that sense, language and sexualized images are not suitable for lectures and promotional actions by sponsors. Reporting violations If you feel harassed, discriminated against, or humiliated, or if you witnessed any of these behaviors, please contact the Response Team. In face of any allegation of violation of these principles, the Response Team will examine and consider the case in order to take action to ensure that such events will not happen again. These actions might take the form of a conversation to reconcile the parties, an invitation to leave the event indefinitely, or any other form to uphold the values stated in this Code of Conduct.","title":"Python Sul’s Code of Conduct"}],"description":"","language":"en","pages":[{"description":"","key":null,"language":"en","link":"/en/","title":"Python Sul 2026 - Londrina - PR"},{"description":"","key":"cdc","language":"en","link":"/en/code-of-conduct/","title":"Python Sul’s Code of Conduct"},{"description":"","key":null,"language":"en","link":"/en/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"description":"Stay up to date with the latest community news and learn more about Porto Alegre, the host city of 2026.","key":null,"language":"en","link":"/en/blog/","title":"PySul 2026 Blog posts"},{"description":"","key":null,"language":"en","link":"/en/tags/","title":"Tags"}],"sections":[{"description":"News, articles, and updates about PySul 2026.","id":"blog","title":"PySul 2026 Blog"},{"description":"The PySul 2026 program is now live!
